## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting brain strokes using machine learning techniques, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset of CT scan images to classify images as either "Stroke" or "No Stroke". The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and the project uses TensorFlow for model development and now utilizes React.js for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend.

### Key Features:
- **Machine Learning Model**: CNN model built using TensorFlow for classifying brain strokes based on CT scan images.
- **User Interface**: React.js frontend for easy image uploading and displaying predictions.
- **Backend**: FastAPI serves the model for predictions and handles image processing.
- **Visualization**: Includes model performance metrics such as accuracy, ROC curve, PR curve, and confusion matrix.

### Dataset:
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Brain Stroke CT Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/afridirahman/brain-stroke-ct-image-dataset)
- **Classes**: The dataset contains two categories:
  - **Normal** (No Stroke)
  - **Stroke** (Brain Stroke)

## Project Structure

### Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture consists of:
- 3 Convolutional layers with ReLU activation and MaxPooling.
- 2 Dense layers of 500 units with ReLU activation.
- Dropout layers (20%) for regularization.
- A final dense layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

**Training**: The model was trained on images resized to 224x224 pixels, normalized for optimal learning.

### Evaluation Metrics:

- **Accuracy on Test Data**: 90%+
- **ROC and PR Curves**: Graphical metrics to evaluate the model's performance.
- **Loss and Accuracy**: Tracked during training for both training and validation sets.
